			 <h2>X'Trapolis 2 Fleet</h2>
        <p>The X’Trapolis 2.0 is a brand-new fleet of electric multiple unit (EMU) trains designed to replace the ageing Comeng fleet and modernize Melbourne’s suburban rail system. As of this being written they are currently being tested and are thought to release late 2025 to early 2026</p>
	         <p>&nbsp;Developed by Alstom, the X’Trapolis 2.0 builds on the success of the original X’Trapolis 100 but adds a range of upgrades in capacity, safety, accessibility, and energy efficiency. </p>
        <p>These trains will be fully compatible with Melbourne’s existing infrastructure — a key improvement over previous fleets that had restrictions on where they could run.</p>

    <h2>features and facts</h2>
    <p>Three wide doors per carriage — for fast boarding and reduced dwell time, like X’Trapolis 100 but redesigned for modern crowds</p>
		<p>Fully walk-through design — passengers can move freely between carriages</p>
		<p>Improved accessibility — includes level boarding, wheelchair spaces, priority seating, and hearing loops</p>
		<p>Digital systems — real-time passenger information, CCTV, intercoms, and modern driver interfaces</p>
		<p>Energy-efficient — regenerative braking and low-energy LED lighting</p>
		<p>Quiet ride — improved suspension and noise insulation compared to X’Trapolis 100</p>
		<h3>Accessability and Comfort</h3>
		<p></p>
		<p>Built to meet Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) requirements</p>
		<p>Wider doors and low-floor design allow easier boarding with no ramps at compatible stations</p>
		<p>Better air conditioning, smoother suspension, and more open standing areas improve overall comfort</p>
		<h3>Manufacturing and Jobs</h3>
		<p></p>
		<p>The X’Trapolis 2.0 will be built at Alstom’s Ballarat factory, helping to sustain up to 750 jobs</p>
		<p>Uses at least 60% local content, part of Victoria’s push for local manufacturing</p>
		<p>The project also supports long-term maintenance jobs and upgrades at key depots</p>
		<h3>Future Role</h3>
		<p></p>
		<p>Initially replacing Comeng trains on lines like:

Craigieburn,

Upfield,

Frankston.

<p></p>Expected to be a long-term backbone of Melbourne’s metro-style suburban network alongside HCMTs</p>
	<p>The "2.0" in the name isn't just for show — it's a ground-up redesign, not just an upgrade. Even though it shares the X’Trapolis name, it’s entirely new technology, suited to the next 30+ years of network growth and passenger demand.</p>
