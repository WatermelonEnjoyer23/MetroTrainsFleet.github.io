			 <h2>Comeng fleeT&nbsp;</h2>
			<p>Comeng trains are the longest-serving electric multiple units (EMUs) in Melbourne’s metropolitan rail network. Built by Commonwealth Engineering (Comeng) in Dandenong between 1981 and 1988, they represent a foundational part of the city’s transport history. Originally commissioned to replace the last of the aging Harris trains, the Comeng fleet was designed to suit Melbourne’s suburban environment with durable stainless-steel bodies, air-conditioning, and a modular carriage system that allowed for flexible operation and maintenance. These trains have served multiple generations of commuters and remain in operation across several lines despite their age.</p>
		<p>The comeng trains were designed in melbourne and were made high quality, although having some reliablity and cleanliness issues (which is because 
			of these trains extremely extensive lifespan and not about the design). The trains became a fan favourite with communters and train enthusiasts, and lead to little to no controversies about them.

    <h2>Refurbishment</h2>
    <p>There have been two major refurbishment programs for the Comeng fleet:</p>

	<p>Early 2000s Refurbishment:
This program was divided between Alstom and EDi Rail, each responsible for refurbishing half of the fleet. Alstom's upgrades focused on electronic systems and passenger comfort, including digital passenger information displays, new flooring, improved lighting, and brighter interiors. EDi Rail’s version included new seating layouts, improved driver cab ergonomics, and updated door mechanisms. These refurbishments led to a clear visual and operational distinction between the “Alstom” and “EDi” Comengs, still noticeable today in their door operation sounds and some cabin layouts. </p>
