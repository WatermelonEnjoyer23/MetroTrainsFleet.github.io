			 <h2>Siemens Fleet</h2>
			<p>The Siemens Nexas trains form a key part of Melbourne’s electric train fleet, introduced in the early 2000s as part of a modernization effort for the city’s rail network. Built by Siemens in Germany and assembled in Austria, these trains were Melbourne’s first fully imported EMUs and featured a sleek, modern European design. Known for their smooth ride and wide, open carriages, the Nexas fleet stands out for its quiet operation and high acceleration, making it ideal for longer, express services across the network.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Modifications</h2>
		<p> The siemens were a cheap design ordered from europe, unlike all the others (discluding the xtrapolis 100) that were made mostly or fully in Melbourne. This lead to a bunch of compatability problems and issues over the years</p>
    <p>In their early years, Siemens trains faced significant braking issues, including incidents where trains overshot platforms. In 2006, a temporary speed restriction and extensive safety testing were introduced, and modifications were made to address the issue.
		</p>
<p> Additional upgrades were carried out to improve door systems, driver visibility, and communications equipment, as well as to comply with accessibility and fire safety standards.</p>
		
	<p>The siemens fleet only have 2 doors, which causes crowding near the doors during peak periods, as passengers funnel through just two access points per carriage. This has been a problem with the fleet as it can cause longer dwell times, which sometimes disrupts service punctuality on heavily used lines.</p>
